The film was predominantly shot in [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala"), with few sequences being shot at [Hassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan,_Karnataka "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan,_Karnataka") in [Karnataka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka").
